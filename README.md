Title: Reforming the Parental Matchmaking Market in China  
Time: April 2024 - June 2024  
In my "Market Design" class, my classmate and I completed an independent research project. We aimed to apply the economic concepts we had learned, such as matching and auction models, to a practical scenario. The project involved quantitative/ qualitative research, data preparation, and model building, and it culminated in a 16-page research paper. In particular, we propose an adaption of the Gale-Shapley model to the marriage market in China with the unique cultural characteristic of parent match-making. Our paper received 93% and I achieved a final grade of A in this class.
